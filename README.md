# Collaborating

To edit the code you just need to have Android Studio installed and properly configured. Since it uses Gradle, all the dependencies will be automagically downloaded for you. 

# Using it

In the dist folder there is a moviebinder-debug.apk. Just download it and install on your phone.

# Updates

I'll update this application, to improve the layout and add some more functionalities in the future.
